- Self-taught **Python enthusiast** with 12+ years of personal programming experience
- 9+ years as a teacher/tutor, recently 3 years at Texas A&M as a peer teacher for first-year engineering
- Graduated in May 2025 with **Bachelor's in Multidisciplinary Engineering, Mechatronics Track**, from Texas A&M
- Researcher in **educational psychology** and **engineering education**
- Pursuing a **Master's of Science in Engineering Technology**
--- 

Currently, my main interests specifically revolve around:
- machine learning (RAG, deep neural network)
- physical educational aids
- online and virtual educational materials
- teaching, tutoring, and their strategies

**Machine Learning:** This is a relatively new field to me, and I have touched on it over the last couple years. However, with  my Master's thesis being centered on it (particularly deep neural networks), I have decided to take a deep dive into ML!
- Current Project: TBD
- Previous Projects:
  - [Gesture](https://github.com/AxeFontaine/tamuhack25) - TAMUHack 2025 - created and trained a model using a self-made ASL alphabet dataset for backend
  - [ASL Detection project](https://github.com/RicePandaaaa/ASL-RNN-ApplyAI) - Apply AI (AI4All) - fine-tuned recurrent neural networks to identify words formed in American Sign Language
---
 
**Physical Educational Aids:** As an undergrad, I learned a lot about robotics and related fields. Along with software, I have been looking more into creating more accessible learning aids!
- Current Project:
  - Flashcard Robot: Physical robot that helps sort and show flashcards using the spaced repetition learning method

---

**Online and Virtual Educational Materials:** I am a big proponent in utilizing digital services to make learning materials more accessible! Currently I am tackling this through web apps and my YouTube channel!
- Current Projects:
  - [Intro to Python textbook](https://github.com/RicePandaaaa/TonyIntroToPython): Interactive online textbook for learning and practicing the basics of Python
  - [@ricepandateaches YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ricepandateaches/): Developing a series on teaching Python fundamentals and coding tutorials
- Previous Projects:
  - [ENGR 102 Reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I198gkjpnqE&list=PLISyINFRGf7ZQ6jvPNtmXOIR4q-9UGYE8&pp=gAQB): Exam review series for the freshmen computational course (ENGR 102) I helped teach at Texas A&M
  - [Precalculus Review Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJel1S3xqNE&list=PLISyINFRGf7an5UwX27hjwT-5-Rtw1BHp&pp=gAQB): Review series for pre-calculus for a class I helped mentor for [SEAS](https://engineering.tamu.edu/student-life/seas/index.html)

**Teaching, Tutoring, and Their Strategies:** Teaching and tutoring are two of my greatest passions! To become a better educator though, it is important for me to learn more about the theory behind it all and work on tools that improve my quality of teaching.
- Current Project:
  - [Canvas Grade Analyzer](https://github.com/RicePandaaaa/CanvasGradeAnalyzer): Web app for that visualizes and breaks down the gradebook data, that was exported from a Canvas course, with tables and charts
- Previous Projects:
  - Undergraduate Student Researcher - [BEAM lab](https://sites.google.com/view/beamresearchtamu/research?authuser=0) @ Texas A&M - helped collect data, prepare interviews, and read literature pertaining to how math education can be affected by one's beliefs, emotions, and attitudes
