- Self-taught **Python enthusiast**, been coding for fun for 13+ years
- Tutoring and teaching on the side for 9+ years at the K-12 and collegiate levels
--- 

Currently, my main interests specifically revolve around:
- machine learning
- physical educational aids
- online and virtual educational materials
- teaching, tutoring, and their strategies

---

**Machine Learning:** This is a relatively new field to me, and I have touched on it over the last couple years. However, with  my Master's thesis being centered on it (particularly deep neural networks), I have decided to take a deep dive into ML!
- Current Project: Developing a hybrid search system to better analyze individual and groups of course curricula
- Previous Projects:
  - [Gesture](https://github.com/AxeFontaine/tamuhack25) - TAMUHack 2025 - created and trained a model using a self-made ASL alphabet dataset for backend
  - [ASL Detection project](https://github.com/RicePandaaaa/ASL-RNN-ApplyAI) - Apply AI (AI4All) - fine-tuned recurrent neural networks to identify words formed in American Sign Language

---

**Online and Virtual Educational Materials:** I am a big proponent in utilizing digital services to make learning materials more accessible! Currently I am tackling this through web apps and public repos!
- Current Projects:
  - [Intro to Python textbook](https://github.com/RicePandaaaa/TonyIntroToPython): Interactive online textbook for learning and practicing the basics of Python
- Previous Projects:
  - [ENGR 102 Notes](https://github.com/RicePandaaaa/TAMU-ENGR-102-Notes): Review notes for ENGR 102 (computation with Python) concepts in the form of PDFs and Jupyter Notebooks 
  - [ENGR 102 Reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I198gkjpnqE&list=PLISyINFRGf7ZQ6jvPNtmXOIR4q-9UGYE8&pp=gAQB): Exam review series for ENGR 102 I helped teach at Texas A&M
  - [Precalculus Review Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJel1S3xqNE&list=PLISyINFRGf7an5UwX27hjwT-5-Rtw1BHp&pp=gAQB): Review series for pre-calculus for a class I helped mentor for [SEAS](https://engineering.tamu.edu/student-life/seas/index.html)

**Teaching, Tutoring, and Their Strategies:** Teaching and tutoring are two of my greatest passions! To become a better educator though, it is important for me to learn more about the theory behind it all and work on tools that improve my quality of teaching.
- Current Project:
  - [Canvas Grade Analyzer](https://github.com/RicePandaaaa/CanvasGradeAnalyzer): Web app for that visualizes and breaks down the gradebook data, that was exported from a Canvas course, with tables and charts
